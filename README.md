The Android-based mobile game I developed is designed using React Native and Expo Go and runs on a client-server architecture. Players log in, select the game type and word count, and join channels. Opponents take turns asking for words and trying to guess them; if a word is not entered within a certain time, the player is considered defeated. At the end of the game, scoring is done, results are displayed and players can be invited to new duels. Disconnections and timeouts are managed for a seamless gaming experience.
